# Predicting Company ESG Performance using Random Forest and XGBoost
This project aims to predict the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance of companies based on their financial data and company characteristics.

## Dataset
Dataset used:
- Company ESG Financial Dataset (sourced from Kaggle)
- link: [Kaggle - ESG and Financial Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/esg-and-financial-performance-dataset)

## Libraries
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
  
## Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Prerocessing (handling missing values, outlier treatment, scaling, encoding)
3. Model Building using Random Forest and XGBoost
4. Feature Important Analysis

## Key Findings
Random Forest achieved the best performance with RÂ² score of 0.729.
Financial factors (such as Revenue and Profit Margin) and regional characteristics significantly influence ESG performance.

## Notes
This project was developed for academic and learning purposes,
